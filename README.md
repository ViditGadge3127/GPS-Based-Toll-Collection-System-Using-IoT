# GPS-Based-Toll-Collection-System-Using-IoT
The GPS-Based Toll Collection System automates toll payments using IoT and real-time GPS tracking. When a vehicle enters a toll zone, charges are automatically deducted from a digital wallet stored in Supabase. It ensures secure transactions, instant notifications, and error handling, with future scalability for AI and RFID integration.

GPS-Based Toll Collection System Using IoT

Project Overview:-

The **GPS-Based Toll Collection System** is an innovative, real-time automated toll tax deduction system that leverages IoT technology to track vehicle locations and deduct toll charges seamlessly. This system eliminates the need for physical toll booths, reducing traffic congestion and eliminating the manual collection process. The solution ensures an efficient, cashless, and user-friendly toll payment mechanism that integrates real-time tracking, automated deductions, and secure cloud-based transactions.

#Key Features:-

✔ Automated Toll Deduction – Detects vehicle presence in a toll zone and automatically deducts charges.
✔ Real-time GPS Tracking – Uses Neo-6M GPS module to continuously track vehicle movement.
✔ Cloud Database Integration – Uses Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for transaction storage and management.
✔ Secure Wallet System – Each vehicle is linked to a virtual wallet for automatic toll payments.
✔ Instant Notifications – Sends alerts via **Twilio API** to notify users of successful transactions.
✔ Error Handling & Security – Implements data validation, API authentication, and encryption to ensure security.
✔ Scalable & Flexible Design – The system can be expanded for use across multiple toll booths nationwide.

# Technology Stack

- Hardware: Neo-6M GPS Module, Bolt IoT Module
- Software & Programming: Python, JavaScript, APIs
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based real-time database)
- Cloud & Web Services: Firebase, Twilio API (for SMS alerts)
- Security Measures: Data encryption, API authentication, secure transactions

# System Architecture

1. GPS Data Collection: The Neo-6M GPS module** continuously sends real-time location data to the **Bolt IoT module**.
2. Data Processing in Python: The IoT module forwards raw GPS data to a Python-based backend, which extracts latitude and longitude values and converts them into a structured format.
3. Toll Booth Proximity Check: The system compares the vehicle's current location with predefined toll booth locations stored in **Supabase**.
4. Automated Toll Deduction: If the vehicle enters a toll zone, the system checks the wallet balance linked to the vehicle in Supabase and deducts the toll amount accordingly.
5. Transaction Logging: Each successful toll deduction is logged in the **Supabase database**, ensuring accurate financial tracking.
6. User Notification System: The system sends **SMS alerts via Twilio API** to notify users of successful toll payments.

#  Implementation Steps**

#1. Hardware Setup:

- Connect the Neo-6M GPS module to the Bolt IoT device (TX → RX connection).
- Ensure continuous power supply and real-time data transmission.

### **2. Python Code for Data Processing:**

- Read raw GPS data.
- Extract latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Convert coordinates into human-readable format.
- Compare real-time location with stored toll booth locations.

### **3. Supabase Database Design:**

#### **Tables Used:**

- Vehicle Data Table: Stores vehicle numbers, owners, and wallet balances.
- Toll Booth Locations Table: Stores predefined GPS coordinates of toll booths.
- Transaction Log Table: Records timestamped toll transactions.

# 4. Automated Deduction Logic:

- If vehicle location matches a toll zone, check wallet balance.
- Deduct the toll fee if sufficient funds are available.
- Update the database and send a user notification.

### **5. Error Handling & Security Measures:**

- GPS Signal Loss Handling: If GPS data is missing, retry fetching data before proceeding.
- Data Validation:** Ensure latitude and longitude values are within expected ranges before processing.
- Duplicate Entry Prevention: Prevent multiple deductions for the same vehicle within a short time.
- Encryption & API Security: Use encrypted communication between IoT devices, Python backend, and Supabase.

#Scalability & Future Enhancements

- Machine Learning for Traffic Prediction: Predict toll booth congestion based on vehicle movement data.
- RFID Integration: Combine GPS tracking with RFID-based verification for enhanced security.
- Dynamic Pricing Model: Implement toll price variations based on traffic conditions.
- Cross-Country Toll Management: Expand the system for seamless toll payments across different regions.
- Mobile App Integration: Develop a mobile app for users to track toll history, manage wallets, and receive real-time updates.

# Conclusion

The GPS-Based Toll Collection System is a game-changer in automated toll tax deduction, eliminating manual interventions and enhancing efficiency. By leveraging IoT, Python, Supabase, and APIs, this system ensures secure, seamless, and real-time toll payments. Its flexible architecture allows easy scalability, making it a promising solution for modern toll management systems.
